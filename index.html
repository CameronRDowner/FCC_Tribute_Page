  <h3 class="white-text">Medium</h3>
  <p class="gray-text paragraph-styling">The artists choice in medium, oil paint on canvas, promotes the ability to create well blended elements and realistic lighting effects. Even though this medium doesn’t make it easy to create well defined lines, Hopper achieved this masterfully. This is due not only to his skill in painting straight and proportionate lines, but is his ability to use contrasting colors to make the lines appear more defined and dimensional. Examples of this are the trim around the windows of the diner; the portions of the window pillars that are facing inward, he paints lighter hues, while making the outward portions a dark, almost black hue. He also uses a technique where he layers several slightly different hues next to each other, when illustrating elements of the trim on the buildings. This use of contrasting colors makes the lines pop and adds a aspect of realism to this composition; it also gives off the illusion of dimension, and promotes a realistic lighting effect often seen when light shines on something that has different angles.</p>
     <h3 class="white-text">Unity</h3>
    <p class="gray-text paragraph-styling">
      Even though the focal point of this piece, the diner is off center, Hopper used some different techniques to help unify this composition and bring about balance. Firstly, he used complimentary colors to help make the neighboring buildings stand out. This keeps the right half of the piece from having too much emphasis and outshining the left portion. Another aspect of this piece that adds to its unity is Hopper’s use of patterns. Hopper used the repetition of elements in this composition to help balance out the left side. Examples of this is how the neighboring buildings have a repetition of large storefront windows across the bottom, and a row of small picture windows across the top. Lastly, he uses the street running between the diner and the other building to separate these two large elements of this composition, and give a sense of depth and dimension. </p>
  <h3 class="white-text">Style</h3>
  <p class="gray-text paragraph-styling">
    There is no doubt that Hopper created the people and aesthetics of this place after the popular 1940’s movie trend, film noir. Film noir movies were murder mystery flicks that were especially popular in the 40’s. These movies often had a tough-guy detective, dressed in a sharp-looking suit and fedora who would attempt to solve the murder and track down the killer. Films like these heavily relied on dramatic effects, expressive lighting, and theatrical scenes. The people in Nighthawks seem to be like characters right out of a noir film; the two men are sharply dressed in black suits and fedoras and the woman is clothed in a very noir-esk bright flashy red dress. The perspective in this piece is very cinematic; the light dramatically shines into the dimly lit streets outside, as the people in the scene sit in the diner to escape the darkness of night.
